/**
 * Grading + Rounding
 * <p>
 * HackerLand University has the following grading policy:
 * <p>
 * Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.
 * Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.
 * Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:
 * <p>
 * 1. If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
 * 2. If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
 * <p>
 * For example, grade = 84 will be rounded to 85 but grade = 29 will not be rounded because the
 * rounding would result in a number that is less than 40.
 * <p>
 * Given the initial value of grade for each of Sam's n students, write code to automate the rounding process.
 * Complete the function solve that takes an integer array of all grades, and return an integer array consisting
 * of the rounded grades. For each grade(i), round it according to the rules above and print the result on a new line.
